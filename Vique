/V lanugage should allow containers to know what data should go inside of it with a more automated predictive language model than Microsoft and like competitors.
Andrew Kieckhefer code Language Learning Model (LLM) calculating social app data for predictive data output.

DOCUMENTATION FOR SOCIAL APP SMART AUTOMATED CODE, new language, /V
Also known as the "Harry Potter" artificial intelligence, (AI) code, it's /Vame is nameless, just documented. 
We essentially have infinity containers of the first character shared with the language computing interface.

/? Decipher context of single character R

Similar to escape character sequence formatting with different language behavior design. Uses calculatio/Vs to understand if the characters compose an acronym or abbreviation of otherwise spelt out words.

The data value is coin gold standard for private trade value in coinsurance through coins extra. As data volume increases, so does the value of the digital currency coins extra. 

Data storage backs up abstract assets such as data to hard assets like real estate. 

Coins extra is a privately traded coin available by cash or check investment.

The reason why this code is a point of interest is data mining characters to when users complete a string and space, string and enter, or just string. Finally not only does punctuation matter, each space decision is recognized and keyed into machine learning.

We care because the data model will operate more efficiently than traditional spell checkers and predictive text. 

/V should anticipate entire concepts and accurate predictive word choices from user context before an item is keyed in.
